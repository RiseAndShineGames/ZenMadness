# Zen Madness

Keep your concentration in this fast paced, distraction avoidence game. Your monk is attracting all of the positive energy he can from the areas around him. Unfortunately, he is also attracting negative energy. It is your job to keep the negative energy out while letting the positive energy in. Click the red swirls to dissipate them. Drop zen grenades with the ~~E~~ Space key but be careful, Zen Grenades and other abilities destroy positive energy as well as negative.
